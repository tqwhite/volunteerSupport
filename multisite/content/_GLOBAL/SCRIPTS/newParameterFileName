story='Kaid is a feisty and lovable companion.  He is the self-appointed protector of our home and makes sure to get our attention anytime something is awry.  We had a maintenance person come in once while we were gone and when we got back Kaid wouldnâ€™t leave us alone until we looked at where the intruder had worked.  His favorite activities include chasing (and eating) feathers and ribbons of all kinds, lying on fleece blankets in the sun and watching the world out the window.  Kaid turns seven this May and we hope to enjoy many more years of his company.';
