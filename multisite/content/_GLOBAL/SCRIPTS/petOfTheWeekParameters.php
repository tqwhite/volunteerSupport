$story='Introducing Ivan - he is a 10 year old Siberian Husky - He is a "foster failure" through MUSHR (Minnesota Unwanted Siberian Husky Rescue). He joined our family approximately 5 years ago - The original plan was for mom to pick him up from the owner/surrender and work with him for a short time, then get him adopted. Well, he was an absolute mess when we first got him - an intact male, very underweight, not potty trained and very fearful of everyone and everything. We fed him some good food, he had a quick trip to the vet to get snipped and micro-chipped, had him groomed, and viola - amazing dog! Because the first 5 years of his life were not easy, Ivan gets to see Dr. Jackie a couple times a year, but fortunately mom and dad, he likes going to the Westonka Animal Hospital because he gets lots of loves, and cheese whiz! Ivan and his sister Nikita (also a MUSHR foster failure) both love winter, tolerate summer and always like to be the center of attention (they \&apos;woo\&apos;, A LOT).';
